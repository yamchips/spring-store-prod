# Online Store Backend

## Overview

A fully featured e-commerce backend built with Spring Boot, Spring Security, and Stripe, implementing modern RESTful design principles, JWT authentication, validation, and payment workflows.
Developed as part of Mosh Hamedani’s [“Spring Boot: Building APIs – Part 2” course](https://codewithmosh.com/p/spring-boot-building-apis), this project demonstrates production-grade backend architecture, clean code design, and cloud deployment.

## Features

### API design

- REST APIs for products, users, shopping carts, and orders
- DTOs + MapStruct for clean data transfer and separation of concerns
- Jakarta Validation for strong request validation with custom annotations
- Global exception handling with detailed error messages and HTTP codes
- Swagger UI integration for live, interactive API documentation

### Authentication & Authorization

- Stateless JWT-based authentication
- Access and refresh tokens with configurable expiry
- Role-based access control for USER and ADMIN
- Password hashing with BCryptPasswordEncoder
- Secure secret and key management using .env and Spring Dotenv

### Shopping Cart & Orders

- UUID-based cart system for secure and unique identifiers
- APIs for adding, updating, removing, and clearing cart items
- Automatic total price calculation per cart and per item
- Rich domain design — cart and order entities encapsulate their own logic
- Seamless checkout flow that converts a cart to an order
- EntityGraph + JPQL used to eliminate N+1 queries for performance

### Payment Integration

- Stripe Checkout for real-world payment processing
- Webhook endpoint to receive Stripe payment events
- Auto-updates order status on successful payments
- Decoupled payment layer via PaymentGateway interface (future PayPal integration possible)
- Transactional handling with robust error control

### Postman Testing

- Organized collection includes Auth, Product, Cart, and Order folder
- Use global variables such as baseUrl, accessToken, refreshToken, and cartId
- Profile-based configuration (dev / prod) for environment isolation

### Additional Highlights

- Modularized Spring Security rules for maintainability
- Global Flyway migrations for database versioning
- Cloud deployment on Railway with managed MySQL

### Example API Flow

Here is a sample flow to help you understand how to interact with the API after starting the application.

1. Get all products

`GET /products`

The database is automatically populated with 10 sample products.

2. Create a shopping cart

`POST /carts`

This will return the cart ID. You don't need to be logged in to create a cart.

3. Add items to cart

Once you have a cart ID, you can add products by sending:

`POST /carts/{cartId}/items`

Request body example:

```
{
    "productId": 1
}
```

4. Register a new user

To check out, you have to register and login first:

`POST /users`

Request body example:

```
{
    "name": "Harry Potter",
    "email": "harry@gmail.com",
    "password": "123456"
}
```

5. Login to get an access token

Hit this endpoint:

`POST /auth/login`

Request body example:

```
{
    "email": "harry@gmail.com",
    "password": "123456"
}
```

6. Checkout

After login, you can check out by hitting this endpoint:

`POST /checkout`

Headers example:

`Authorization: Bearer json-web-token`

Request body example:

```
{
    "cartId": "target-cart-id"
}
```

The response contains a Stripe checkout URL. Open it in the browser to complete the payment using a test card:

```
Card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
Expiry: any future date
CVC: 123
```

7. Webhook & Order status update

Once payment is completed, Stripe will trigger a webhook call to:

`POST /checkout/webhook`

This backend listens for this event and updates the order status in the database accordingly.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/yamchips/online-store-backend

```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root, set following variables:
- JWT_SECRET
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
- STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY

### 3. Run App

This is a Maven project. To start the application, run

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Once running, the application will be available at:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

Swagger UI is available at:
